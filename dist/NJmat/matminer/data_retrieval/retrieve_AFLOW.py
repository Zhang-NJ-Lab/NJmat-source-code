    """Retrieves data from the AFLOW database.

    AFLOW uses the AFLUX API syntax, and the aflow library handles the HTTP
    requests for material properties. Note that this helper library is not an
    official repository of the AFLOW consortium. However, this library does
    dynamically generate the keywords supported by the AFLUX API from their
    servers, which makes it robust against changes in the AFLOW system.

        The method builds an AFLUX API query from pymongo-like filter criteria
        and requested properties. Then, results are collected over HTTP. Note
        that the "compound", "auid", and "aurl" fields are always returned.

        Args:
            criteria: (dict) Pymongo-like query operator. The first-level
                dictionary keys must be supported AFLOW properties. The values
                of the dictionary must either be singletons (int, str, etc.) or
                dictionaries. The keys of this second-level dictionary can be
                the pymongo operators '$in', '$gt', '$lt', or '$not.' There can
                not be further nesting.
                VALID:

                See the api link for a list of supported properties.
            files: (list of str) For convenience, specific files may also be
                downloaded as pymatgen objects. Each file download is collected
                by a separate HTTP request (read slow). The default behavior is
                to return none of these objects. Supported files:
                    "prototype_structure" - the prototype structure
                    "input_structure" - the input structure
                    "band_structure" - TODO
                    "dos" - TODO
            request_size: (int) Number of results to return per HTTP request.
            request_limit: (int) Maximum number of requests to submit. The
                default behavior is to request all matching records.
            index_auid: (bool) Whether to set the "AFLOW unique identifier" as
                the index of the DataFrame.

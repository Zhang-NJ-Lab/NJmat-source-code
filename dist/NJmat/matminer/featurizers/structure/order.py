    How much the ordering of species in the structure differs from random

    These parameters describe how much the ordering of all species in a
    structure deviates from random using a Warren-Cowley-like ordering
    parameter. The first step of this calculation is to determine the nearest
    neighbor shells of each site. Then, for each shell a degree of order for
    each type is determined by computing:

    :math:`\\alpha (t,s) = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_n w_n \\delta (t - t_n)}{x_t \\sum_n w_n}`

    where :math:`w_n` is the weight associated with a certain neighbor,
    :math:`t_p` is the type of the neighbor, and :math:`x_t` is the fraction
    of type t in the structure. For atoms that are randomly dispersed in a
    structure, this formula yields 0 for all types. For structures where
    each site is surrounded only by atoms of another type, this formula
    yields large values of :math:`alpha`.

    The mean absolute value of this parameter across all sites is used
    as a feature.

    Features:
        mean ordering parameter shell [n] - Mean ordering parameter for
            atoms in the n<sup>th</sup> neighbor shell
